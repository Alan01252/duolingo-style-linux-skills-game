Experimenting with react / redux / and serverless.io

# Demo

# Reasons

I wanted to experiment with AWS Lambda, React and Redux. My regex skills were a little rusty so I thought I'd begin by writing 
a quick game that tested my regex skills.

# Further work

Expand to include other linux skills, sed, awk, grep and basic other command line tools.
